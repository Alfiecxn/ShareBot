Run on python 3.9
--------------------
If you get a "missing" error or a "module not found" error
open a prompt terminal and type 'pip install [what was missing]'
i couldn't be bothered making a requirements.txt so
EXAMPLE:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'

Type:
pip install requests
